Pokemon: Wild Encounter Moveset Calculator

This project takes in pokemon and movesets to calculate the moveset of a
given Pokemon and it's level.

Movesets are determined by it's (generational) learnset, in order by level
learned. Pokemon can only "remember" up to four moves at a time, removing
moves by First In First Out (FIFO)

Movesets compiled in platinumDexMovesets.txt, in a psuedo-CSV format.
